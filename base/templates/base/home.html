                        <h4>Coding Experience</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p> I have been learning how to code for about 6 months now since September of 2023 when
                            I started to attend a conversion course - MSc Software Development - at University of Glasgow.
                            Before that I had no coding experience prior & my BSc degree was Quantity Surveying which I 
                            obtained at Heriot-Watt University. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been primarly learning Java in the course & want to learn more & improve my coding 
                            skills & knowledge. My current goal is to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript & improve my Java.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall coding so far has been a difficult concept to grasp & I want to get better at programming, but I am willing to put in the work!

                                    the Java Card Game & a Hotel Construction Project. In addition to this I have had to use teamwork 
                                    in Rugby & when I was an Assistant Cost Consultant at Currie & Brown.

                                    <em>Adaptability</em> - Adapatability has been shown during one of the Hackathons. We were tasked as 
                                    a team to create a project that promotes sustainability & we decided on making a video game showcasing
                                    the negative impacts of pollution. With a short time-span of 2 days we initially wanted to use Unity but instead
                                    decied to use Godot. None of us had any knowledge of game developing so it was difficult at first but we manage
                                    to finish.
